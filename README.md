## MostHarmfulUSWeatherEvents

We analyze 62 years of NOAA data on severe weather events to determine the most harmful and expensive. The data set of over 900,000 events records, among other things, the type of event, the property damage and crop damage caused, and any fatalities and injuries. Looking first at property and crop damage, we find that floods are the worst, followed by hurricanes, tornados, and storm surges. Tornados cause the most fatalities and injuries by far, but after tornados the most dangerous are excessive heat, floods, thunderstorm wind, and lightning.
